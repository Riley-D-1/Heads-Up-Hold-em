# Heads-Up-Hold-em
A online gambling game (no real money ofc) that is a modified poker variant where coinflips are used instead. Skillful bluffing, betting and decisions will lead you to glory in coin flipping mayhem.

## Theme
Well I belive I smashed this theme out of the water:
- Gambling around coinflips
- Crazy coin assets 
- Gambling chips are coins as well
- Need I say more

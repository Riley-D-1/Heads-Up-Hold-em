# Heads-Up-Hold-em
A online gambling game (no real money ofc) that is a modified poker variant where coinflips are used instead. Skillful bluffing, betting and decisions will lead you to glory in coin flipping mayhem.

## Theme
Well I belive I smashed this theme out of the water:
- Gambling around coinflips
- Crazy coin assets 
- Gambling chips are coins as well
- Need I say more

## Rules
There are 4 different hand types, ordered from worst to best:
1. Split (3 of each)
2. Quad (4 of the same type)
3. Five Frenzy (5 of the same type)
4. Flip Storm (6 of the same type)
Gameplay Rules
- Player pays the buy-in fee (Costs 6 Money atm)
- Each player flips their 2 private coins.
- Dealer is randomly selected. (In my game player is always dealer)
- A betting round occurs (starting on the dealer). In a clockwise order players can  bet or fold. (Players must all match the bet or can fold)
- The dealer flips 4 community coins.
- Count your heads and tails and use your highest number.
- All personal coins are revealed. The player with the best hand type wins. (If players tie on a hand, heads triumph over tails. If there is still a tie, the pot is split equally.)

- Each player flips their 2 private coins.
- Dealer is randomly selected.
- The dealer starts the betting round. In a clockwise order, players can raise, match, or fold. (Players must all match the bet and can raise it further to continue playing or fold.)
- The dealer flips 4 community coins.
- Count your heads and tails and use your highest number.
- All personal coins are revealed. The player with the best hand type wins. (If players tie on a hand, heads triumph over tails. If there is still a tie, the pot is split equally.)
